 The webclient is a better approach for communication between services

 // as we already know the restTemplate is for synchronous communication which leads to blocking the main thread
 // inside the synchronous rest controller which will potentially lead to the slow performance for the api

 // the solution for the limitations for restTemplate we have webClient

 WebClient is a non-blocking, reactive web client introduced as part of the Spring WebFlux framework.
 It is built to support asynchronous and streaming scenarios,
 making it ideal for applications requiring high concurrency and scalability.

 1. Reactive and Non-Blocking Applications
  WebClient is the go-to choice when developing reactive applications.
  Reactive programming is designed to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently by leveraging non-blocking I/O.
  Use WebClient in the following cases:

    Reactive APIs: If your application uses Reactor, RxJava, or other reactive frameworks, WebClient integrates seamlessly.
    Event-Driven Architectures: Systems that rely on events, such as IoT platforms, benefit from the asynchronous capabilities of WebClient.
