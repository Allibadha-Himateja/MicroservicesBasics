---> The introduction of microservices.
 microservices is an architecture which is upgrade for the traditional monolithic architecture
 Building small,self contained,ready to run applications can bring great flexability and added resilience to the code

 in simple words microservice is a modern approach to software whereby application code is
 delivered in small ,manageable pieces, which are independent to others

 The problem of monolithic architecture which was stepping for microservices architecture is
 the tight coupling of services in one sole server
 challenges in scalability ,development speed, system resilience

 ----> for the implementation of microservice we are going to implement three individual rest controller
 which are running over different ports in the local system

 the idea of microservices is to handle the business logic through multiple services called the microservices
 in this case we have taken three  REST API's
 ->SchoolAPI
 ->StudentAPI
 ->MarksAPI

 the idea of communication in between these apis is done is two fundamental ways :=
 1) Synchronous communication via REST(restTemplate)
 2) Asynchronous communication via webClient(WebFlux)


 /// for the communication between these apis
 ->Schoolapi will call the StudentApi
 ->Studentapi will call the marksapi

 --> but for now we have to make the call from the studentapi to the marksapi and print the list of marks form the
 marks api inside the student api console

 FIRST WAY TO COMMUNICATE TO THE MARKSAPI from STUDENTAPI
 -restTemplate ( included in the Httpclient dependency)
 -RestTemplate is a synchronous client in Spring Boot used to perform HTTP requests,
  simplifying the process of interacting with RESTful web services by abstracting boilerplate code
  associated with HTTP communication.
 -It is commonly used to consume external APIs and facilitates seamless integration with REST services by managing HTTP connections,
 marshaling and unmarshaling data between HTTP requests/responses and Java objects, and handling exceptions.
