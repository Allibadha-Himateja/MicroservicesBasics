// the creation of Eureka Server

//As Netflix transitioned to a microservices architecture,
 they encountered challenges in enabling services to discover and communicate with each other dynamically.
 Traditional methods, like hardcoding service locations or using static configurations,
 proved inadequate in a cloud environment where services frequently scale up or down.

//To address this, Netflix developed Eureka, a service registry that facilitates dynamic service discovery.

// what do we mean by Service Registry and Discovery Clients
// this is a Server whos responsibility is to provide the centralized configuration for all the microservices inside a
// distributed cluster of microservices.

// so the idea of using the eureka server is to register all the discovery client(these clients are nothing but
individual microservices)
 so coming to creating a EUREKA SERVER

STEPS:
1) create a new module inside the directory
2) name that module with EurekaServer
3) add the dependencies for the Eureka Server
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
    </dependency>
4) we have to make eureka configurations in application.properties
    # Eureka Server Configuration
    server.port=8761

    # Disable client-side behavior (crucial for the server)
    eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
    eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
5) and inside the SpringBootApplication file
    we have to register this application with eureka
